        <p>Hi! I'm Jonny, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
        <p>I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.

        <p>In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my chances of winning big.</p>
